# Netflix

For this project, I decided to analyze a data set of Netflix Movie and TV show Titles to see what common trends have occurred over the years. Netflix is one of the biggest video streaming services on the planet with over 7,278 pieces of content on their platform at the time of this data set's collection. With its start as a DVD rental platform, Netflix has risen to make a huge name for itself announcing in 2019 that they had signed on 135 million paid customers worldwide.
A huge factor to their success is the underlying use of Big Data. By gathering information from practically every customer interaction, Netflix tries to get access to the minds of their viewers and recommend what they would like to watch next before they even finish their current movie or show. In this analysis, I wanted to examine the addition of content to Netflix in search for trends and similarities from all regions of Netflix' reach over the world.
This data set was acquired from Kaggle and included many different variables to analyze. I am using the below metrics to analyze the data:
•	Type: It’s a categorical variable with the type of content available whether TV show or movies.
•	Total Duration: Its splits up in two
1.	Movies - Mins
2.	TV shows – Season
•	Actual_Release_Year: The release year for the movie or TV shows
•	Netflix_year: The year the Movie/TV show added to Netflix
•	Netflix_month: The month the Movie/TV show added to Netflix
•	Countries: The countries where the content is being streamed
•	Ratings: the content categorized as per ratings
These are the questions this article will try to answer
1.	Distribution of movies and TV shows added every month.
2.	Type of Content available for audiences.
3.	Globally which countries have large number of Netflix movies and tv shows streamed.
4.	Distribution for duration of movies for Top countries
5.	Distribution of movies change over time.
6.	Was Netflix impacted by pandemic?
